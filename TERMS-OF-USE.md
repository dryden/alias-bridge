2. License and Intellectual Property

We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable license to install and use the Alias Bridge extension on compatible browsers for your personal or internal business use.

The Service, including its code, design, and branding (excluding third‑party components and services), is owned by us or our licensors and is protected by applicable laws.

Open source components (including this project if licensed under MIT) are subject to their respective licenses, which may grant you additional rights.

The Service integrates with third‑party services and libraries, including but not limited to:

- Addy.io (for email alias services).
- Polar.sh (for license management).
- Browser vendors (e.g., Google Chrome) and associated Web Store or extension marketplace.

Your use of those third‑party services is governed by their own terms, privacy policies, and service agreements. We are not responsible for the availability, performance, or policies of third‑party services.

4. Your Responsibilities

You are responsible for:

- Keeping your Addy.io API token and license key secure and not sharing them with others.
- Ensuring your Addy.io account is used in compliance with Addy.io’s terms.

You must not:

- Use aliases for fraudulent, deceptive, or illegal activities.
- Attempt to circumvent license checks or Pro feature restrictions.
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, servers, or networks.

5. Pro Features and Licensing

- Licenses may be issued and managed via Polar.sh or another provider; we may verify license keys directly via Polar.sh APIs.
- You agree not to share or resell license keys or use keys you do not have permission to use.
- We may limit, suspend, or disable Pro features if a license key is found to be invalid, revoked, or abused.

If you charge for access to the Service or use it commercially, you are responsible for complying with all applicable tax, billing, and consumer protection laws.

6. No Warranty

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Service is provided “as is” and “as available,” without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non‑infringement.

Among other things, we do not warrant that:

- The Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error‑free.
- The Service will be compatible with every website, input field, or browser setup.
- Aliases generated by the Service will always be accepted by third‑party websites or services.

You are responsible for verifying that aliases work as expected for your use cases.

7. Limitation of Liability

- We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to your use of or inability to use the Service.

- The amount you paid (if any) for the Service in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations of liability; in such cases, those limitations apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Taiwan, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

11. Miscellaneous
